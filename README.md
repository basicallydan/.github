# Dan Hough – @basicallydan

Hello. I'm Dan, I'm a generalist Software Engineer currently working at
@junglescout here in beautiful Vancouver, BC. I also spend a lot of time
writing music and playing guitar, playing board games and cooking. Also,
my photo is way out of date because I have a beard now :bearded_person:

## 👨‍💻 Software that I work on

* :white_check_mark: [DoneApp](http://danhough.com/blog/done-devlog-3/): A productivity tool for regular tasks
* 💻 [Interfake](https://github.com/basicallydan/interfake): An API mocking tool. It's pretty out-of-date but it works!
* 🎿 [SkiFree.js](http://basicallydan.github.io/skifree.js/): The classic PC Game SkiFree, but in JavaScript.
* :palm_tree: @junglescout: My main squeeze. We make tools for Amazon Sellers.

## :coffee: Let's talk!

**Software things:** I'm interested in API design, testing, browser stuff and
(as long as it's really simple) games!

**Other things:** I'm interested in productivity, strategy games, songwriting,
climbing, snowboarding and linguistics.
